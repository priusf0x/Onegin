   Of course Tattiana was annoyed

   And ditties of the steppe she loved.
   Our heroes at full gallop sped,
   Yet was her inmost soul o’erjoyed
   To dream upon the sunny strand

   When harsh demeanour hath consigned
   Before a cold indifferent crowd,
   When, where, and in what desert land,
   Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?—
   With lengthened howl and accent loud,

   Beneath her lay a strange courtyard,

   From mere vacuity of mind
   Bouyànoff courted. She refused.
   What visions then her fancy thronged—
   A breathless silence then, prolonged—
   Cried the old dame with anguish filled:
   “What can be done? She is no child!”
   And a long time about her talked.
   Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
   They long at home have her expected—
   To Olga frequently he would
   In love’s campaigns Onéguine heard
   Deeming himself a veteran scarred
   Some nice instructive novel read,
   Whose author nature understood
   Better than Chateaubriand did
   Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
   But finally she softly said:
   “Enough, arise! for much we need
   Where many another hand had signed
   Gazing into his face, she said:
   A tender couplet he combined,
   Surely ye all have overhauled
   Which all her darling friends have scrawled
   By friendship how they were abused,
   Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
   Upon the opening page ye find:
   And on the last one, underlined:
   Seems so unnatural and absurd:
   Each gust of temper, silly word,
   And when her violence reviewed—
   Infallibly you there will find
   And vows will probably be signed:
   Of what he thought and what believed,
   Yet I in idleness expend
   Made revelations undesigned,
   My days of life approach their end,
   “I shall expire,” Tattiana cried,
   Onéguine’s pencillings. His mind
   Upon those margins she perceived
   In what he merely acquiesced.
   Onéguine was the most impressed,
   Longtime her mind is occupied.
   “What ails thee?”—“Nothing.”—He is fled.
   But on the third of grove and mead
   The thunderbolt on you descend!
   He took no more the slightest heed;
   An explanation: she was scared,
   And these the attentive maid observed
   In Olga’s album, youthful maid,
   Nor frigid adulation paid.
   What never was remarked or heard
   Of Olga he in song averred;
   His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
   Attentive listened to the lad.
   Though scarcely following what was said,
   Both natural and truthful seemed.
   The company deep silence guard.

   Singing God knows what maid admired,

   The fruits of science, evil, good,
   Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
   Debate commanded ample food—
   And though her soul might be confused,
   Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
   By other thoughts be occupied.
   But such is not for me. I brood
   And vehemently though amazed
   She on the apparition gazed,
   No signs of trouble her accused,
   With Olga; nor of this appeared
   To arid selfishness resigned,
   A mien unaltered she preserved,
   Inseparable they remained.
   She consolation thence obtained—
   At home arriving he addressed
   His immorality of mind
   Her inmost soul had penetrated,
   Her bow was easy, unreserved.

   His visit she had not awaited,
   His mournful heart no peace could find,
   Feeling in others much esteemed.
   A few of different temper deemed,
   Ah no! no faintness her attacked

   And cool sagacious mind he had:
   I was incensed and he was sad.

   But presently she tried to read;
   At early morn returns the maid
   Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
   And such unconsciously he led,

   Adieu she to the matron said
   He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
   That certain volumes she might read.

   A weary season was at hand—
   November at the gate did stand.
   And both of dull existence tired,
   The morn arises foggy, cold,
   Extinct the flame which once had fired;
   The wolf upon the highways bold
   Drive out the cattle from their shed,
   Triquet arose, and for the bard
   The maid whose note he still possessed
   Nor at the hour of noon with sound
   To Dunia then they whisper: Mind!

   Lenski as a good match received,—
   Handsome and rich, the neighbourhood

   Wherefore am I your quarry held?—
   Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
   From the moist cork the bottle freed
   And devastate the woods around.
   Is it that I am now compelled
   Beneath the window-sill his bed,
   The pile of books, with carpet spread
   On chairs in the saloon reposed,
   He round the billiard-table stalked,
   The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
   And Fliànoff, somewhat indisposed,
   The room my former master used.
   A scant attendance Lenski showed
   A book at early morn perused.
   And farewell thou, my gloomy friend,
   Upon the tumbled sofa placed,
   But thou, Bordeaux, art like the friend

   Before he eighteen years attained.

   And saying this Vladimir drained

   And he who, jealousy disarmed,
   Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
   But proudly in his song preserved
   The gifted songster never swerved,
   What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
   What are they? Gladly would I yield
   This life in masquerade concealed,
   To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
   When all around the entrance pressed,
   Sickness more courage doth command
   In the recesses what hath stirred

   His mother from the door doth scold.

   Where is he who doth not deceive?

   Onéguine—the beloved place

   Still the loud stamping doth not cease,
   Still they blow noses, cough, and sneeze,
   or runners, is a vehicle with a hood not unlike a big cradle.]
   And my Eugene the path must trace—
   By every proper-minded wife,
   Should be respected throughout life
   Besides the hobbies of a spouse
   Who thrives this moment as I write,
   A philosophic anchorite:
   Where the first time I saw your face,—
   Poetic transport did infuse,
   A mournful temper on his Muse.
   Again the plague of boyhood—love?
   Tattiana learns the intelligence—
   Of her provincial innocence
   Farewell! thou golden days of love!
   Her toilette’s antiquated style,
   The lamps illuminating shine;
   When the hour came to bid good-bye—
   Shall surely, be it soon or late,
   ’Twas then he loved the tangled grove
   To mark with a contemptuous smile.
   But gazes on Onéguine’s face
   The moon, the lamp of heaven above,
   Another bard with art divine
   Who now could fail to recognize
   These are your relatives, believe:
   What I by relatives conceive?
   Hath pictured in his gorgeous line
   Permit me; is it worth the trouble
   That chosen heroes consecrate,
   Ahem! Ahem! My reader noble,
   To whom we used to consecrate
   “Ye peaceful valleys all, good-bye!
   He will delight you, I am sure,
   And loves you as—a relative!
   And yet he in your cause would strive
   Quite inadvertently meanwhile;
   No longer through her former home;
   Felled a calumniator base!
   Which your true friend with a sweet smile
   But competition I abjure
   The calm existence which I prize
   A promenade in twilight late
   And what will Destiny concede?”
   With tears which secret sufferers love—
   That a friend’s arm in every case
   Dark, unavailing reverie,
   Great sacrifices for his sake!
   He deemed his friends but longed to make
   and secondly to “Eda,” by Baratynski, a poem descriptive of life
   But now in her effulgence pale
   Waiting his coming—his alone!

   Know that thy face that day I see.
   Tattiana, Russian to the core,

   The windows whitened, shutters close—
   On sunny days the glistening rime,
   Sledging, the snows, which at the time

   Remains on earth the unseemly rage,
   Confess, O ye who this peruse,

   Unknown to all, without a tie,

   The servants used to congregate
   As a poetic life serene,
   He racked his brains to find its clue
   A dying man with art to soothe,
   Her eyes were of cerulean blue,
   Dies suddenly: of heirs alone
   Her locks were of a golden hue,
   Which in the elevated sphere
   None could a trace of that impute,
   The choicest flowers of French cuisine,
   And by a sweet delusion he
   Still sovereigns of his spirit were,
   The riot of the world and glare
   Callous to all on earth become—
   The vestibule finds empty quite—
   Lo! the prim cat upon the stove
   All dark and silent hath become;
   None could her beautiful declare,
   Wherein my poor old nurse doth lie
   That guests approach: and when above
   Suddenly to the left hand side,
   She trembled and grew deadly pale.
   Or a swift meteor, may be,
   And disappear in space; then she

   In mother Winter’s strange caprice.
   But Tania’s heart is not at ease,
   To mutter her concealed desire
   He enters. High the cork arose
   A wild enthusiastic tongue,
   And leads a solitary life?
   Deplores a most unworthy spouse
   Wherein the miserable wife
   “What can be drearier than the house,
   Onéguine whither gallops? Ye
   Nor the frost particles inhale
   All which in Paris eager taste,
   Nor the first snow of winter seize

   But merely to exasperate;

   In horror for itself alone,
   I say without poetic phrase,
   I would desire my bride to be—
   Then, I say truly, none but thee

   Another could her heart engage,

   It matters not. Hope e’en to these
   Ladies in crowds around her close,
   We must admit but little taste
   But I must add to what I write
   Your frankness I shall compensate
   But I came not to adulate:
   Now, as in a deserted house,
   Feelings which long had ceased to be
   The blood boiled and the passions strove.
   And enmity and hope and love—
   With childlike lisp will lie to please.

   Tranquilly goes to sleep at home,
   And straight returning whence he came,
   He takes his seat, concludes his game,
   To take a hand at whist oft come:

   But round the hostess scintillate
   These take their seats; the coach of state
   By Olga stood, dejected quite
   Destroyed the blossom of his prime.
