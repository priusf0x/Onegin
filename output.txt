   With hopeless passion: from her bed

   By a rich pie were occupied—
   Longtime her mind is occupied.

   “I shall expire,” Tattiana cried,

   To sketch myself that I have tried
   Delusions of a mind untried,

   Successfully to please her tried,
   Ah no! no faintness her attacked
   The balls impelled, the blunt cue chalked;
   And a long time about her talked.
   He round the billiard-table stalked,
   Whither two neighbouring dames have walked
   As if he cruelly had joked!
   Shamefaced, Tattiana downward looked
   This life in masquerade concealed,
   I cannot longer wage concealed.
   By melancholy fogs concealed.
   Tell me, of sentiments concealed
   And such unconsciously he led,
   A hermit’s life Onéguine led,
   He conversation would have led—
   More swift the room Tattiana fled,
   Nor marked how summer’s prime had fled
   Sweet slumber winged its way and fled.
   Soon, of the tempest which hath fled
   And soon the friendly troop hath fled.
   But, I acknowledge, from them fled;
   Of the Tattiana of times fled.
   “What ails thee?”—“Nothing.”—He is fled.
   Repose her silken curtains fled,
   The troop of apparitions fled,
   Nay! even as this instant fled,
   The pains of night have wholly fled,
   And ruthless fashion hath blackballed.

   Zaretski shouted: “Why, he’s killed!”—
   And heard a voice cry—Why! He’s killed!—
   The channel of the river stilled
   Our tender dreamer had enrolled
   A gambling troop when he controlled,
   A life of fact, not fiction, led—
   And to the field of honour led;
   his literary reputation by inditing an “epic” poem entitled
   fast that his sword, projecting from the vehicle, rattled
   Surely ye all have overhauled
   With blood instead of ink she scrawled,
   Which all her darling friends have scrawled
   And in her conversation drawled.
   But since to the backdoor they led
   Transparent o’er the Neva beamed
   The peace which on his forehead beamed,
   But kindness from his eye had beamed
   And when the watery mirror gleamed
   Her the ideal which he dreamed,
   As if some troubled dream she dreamed.
   The purest of the dreams we dreamed,
   She never of deception dreamed
   His elegies, which plenteous streamed,
   The blood gushed from the wound and steamed
   Why is Tattiana guiltier deemed?—
   A few of different temper deemed,
   Onéguine was—so many deemed
   But one buffoon unhappy deemed
   And to revive Tattiana seemed.
   Both natural and truthful seemed.
   And endless the cotillon seemed
   That our desires which noblest seemed,
   [Unerring critics self-esteemed],
   Feeling in others much esteemed.
   A notoriety proclaimed,
   Because my lord, in battles maimed,
   When hope’s delightful flower but bloomed
   He thought so, and existence charmed.
   And he who, jealousy disarmed,
   every male added to its number, though this could have formed
   How soon to habits she conformed
   Ah! how Tattiana was transformed,
   To say farewell, and fussed and fumed
   Only her countenance assumed
   The manly toga scarce assumed,
   Tattiana in despair unfeigned
   Where many another hand had signed
   And vows will probably be signed:
   Her money counted, and designed
   Tall, slender, like thy form designed,
   Made revelations undesigned,
   Though, God be praised! he ne’er designed
   Caricatures he now designed
   That, for the century designed,
   Or even, silent and resigned,
   Spring cheered him up, and he resigned
   To arid selfishness resigned,
                          To exile self-consigned,
   When harsh demeanour hath consigned
   Which Autumn late to earth consigned,
   Once more to idleness consigned,
   Have e’er a precious tress consigned,
   His lyre, to silence now consigned,
   What do I ask? What cause assigned
   A happy destiny ordained:
   A valuable hostage gained,
   A modern Regulus unchained,
   Tattiana o’er the stream complained;
   Whose hearts responsive have remained
   Rooted unto the spot remained.
   Inseparable they remained.
   O ye whom tender love hath pained
   And saying this Vladimir drained
   She consolation thence obtained—
   A something somehow have obtained,
   At fifty who relief obtained
   My sum of happiness contained;
   He sang of life’s fresh colours stained
   Hath tranquilly in turn attained,
   Before he eighteen years attained.
   With us is easily attained.
   The fruits of learning and combined
   And handsome countenance combined,
   A tender couplet he combined,
   With intellect, a taste refined,
   His chambers close wherein confined
   Love to idealize inclined;
   At first for books was disinclined,
   I’m not for witchcraft now inclined.
   And on the last one, underlined:
   Anticipating woe she pined,
   The venerable dame opined
   Certain misfortune near opined.
   Now a long branch itself entwined
   Constant affection intertwined
   If the fond hope I could have fanned
   Tattiana (nurse the project planned)
   There, aping Gulnare’s bard, he spanned
   The date was fixed though oft postponed,
   The maiden’s weary eye which yearned,
   A spirit which for sorrow yearned.
   Tattiana more than ever burned
   His neighbour’s lowly tomb and mourned
   Tattiana thanks to all returned,
   To his Penates now returned,
   The voice of jealousy is drowned.
   Or to pick up her kerchief stooped.
   Our heroes at full gallop sped,
   The matchmaker a fortnight sped,
   Into the cups already sped
   Of lackeys in her pathway grouped,
   Of his approach; but nothing cared
   A countenance perplexed and scared.
   An explanation: she was scared,
   Her features no grimaces bleared;
   Another with cock’s head appeared,
   But Adam Smith to read appeared,
   The tea, as I remarked, appeared,
   A stable, kitchen, fence appeared.
   A faithful model she appeared
   To an assembly—she appeared
   But this a heinous crime appeared
   But in the drawing-room all appeared
   And Tania’s husband soon appeared.—
   For evermore had disappeared.
   O yes! my hopes soon disappeared.”
   My image hath not disappeared,
   With Olga; nor of this appeared
   In dressing-gown at meals appeared.
   Meals, secrets, occupations shared?
   Asunder was and hate prepared?
   He went not—sooner was prepared
   I mused: perhaps the matter’s squared—
   Quarrels among young friends he bred
   Upon the Don’s broad pastures bred
   Both ducks and geese in plenty bred
   Homer, Theocritus, he jeered,
   And many another slily sneered;
   In her affairs ne’er interfered,
   may thus be discovered.]
   Seemed in a haze of green embowered.
   The valleys dried and gaily flowered;
   Their glory with their heels of red
   His soul by crash of music fired,
   Extinct the flame which once had fired;
   By indolence and languor fired
   Singing God knows what maid admired,
   To kiss the feet which I admired!
   In amorous flights when so inspired,
   His tea with rum no more desired,
   ’Tis in your power now, if desired,
   How like the billow I desired
   The fated nutriment desired;
   And both of dull existence tired,
   I write to you! Is more required?
   I long by ballets have been bored,
   An ace at fifteen paces bored.
   Since Fame and Freedom he adored,
   Though beauty he no more adored,
   His ruffian bravery adored,
   Either she saw not or ignored;
   Neighbour by neighbour sat and snored,
   And harmony was soon restored.
   Contented and with victuals stored,
   Deeming himself a veteran scarred
   I long enough deceived have erred.
   Of the romances she preferred,
   And what she from the cards inferred.
   Tattiana every day conferred
   Thus widely meditation erred,
   Tattiana through the forest erred,
   Of Olga he in song averred;
   In the recesses what hath stirred
   Whilst from her countenance ne’er stirred
   And by a partial temper stirred
   And by a genuine sorrow stirred,
   Onéguine’s speeches I abhorred
   Sit many monstrous shapes abhorred.
   He who economy abhorred,
   What hath he dreamed? What hath occurred?
   Of censure for the same incurred;
   The poet from Tamboff secured,
   Till proper rings could be procured.
   Now Didelot scarce can be endured!”
   At first, but soon became inured
   On melted wax in water poured;
   Odes Lenski also had outpoured,
   In fact, some people were assured
   Rebuffed—as quickly reassured,
   A marriageable maid matured,
   Thy cheek is as a poppy red!”
   The shining pistols are uncased,
   Till the fire in her cheek decreased;
   More timid than a doe long chased,
   The contact of the foot I raised
   And leaning ’gainst the portal closed
   You, he a noble mind disclosed,
   On chairs in the saloon reposed,
   To her an elegy composed.
   And Fliànoff, somewhat indisposed,
   Though some men, evilly disposed,
   Lenski that eve in thought immersed,
   In love adventures she was versed,
   But he who by the Muse was nursed
   Or, it may be, the bard had passed
   Alas! for now before her passed
   When Friendship smiled or Love caressed.
   At home arriving he addressed
   At times three words to him addressed
   And when I prayer to Heaven addressed
   Replaced them in their box, undressed
   The style in which my hero dressed;
   When all around the entrance pressed,
   “What ails thee, dear?”—“I feel depressed.
   But sits in bed with air depressed,
   Are not with elegance impressed.
   The image of her seal impressed.
   And kindness Tania was impressed,
   Onéguine was the most impressed,
   And thoughts of Olga first impressed
   Ever by adverse fate oppressed,
   The strange apartment her oppressed:
   Know that your sarcasm ill-suppressed,
   Is it not truth? in tones suppressed
   Bullets are down the barrels pressed,
   How much is in that word expressed!
   So she in French herself expressed.
   Not agony, but death expressed.
   Wherein the heart its vows expressed,
   But once more pensive and distressed
   Then weeping she sank back distressed
   A deadly pallor, air distressed;
   Nor enough strength of mind possessed
   But tremor still her frame possessed,
   The maid whose note he still possessed
   If the poor maiden could have guessed
   Within that secret court discussed,
   Ambassador bought and presented him to Peter the Great who caused
   That rascal Lovelace she abused;
   By friendship how they were abused,
   No signs of trouble her accused,
   The hussar Pykhtin was accused.
   Bouyànoff courted. She refused.
   Nought in the universe refused:
   And though her soul might be confused,
   Hewn, hacked, and otherwise ill-used.
   Some Russian authors he perused—
   A book at early morn perused.
   Not that she had his works perused,
   The room my former master used.
   In fact, the subject analysed,
   Even so! His passions soon abated,
   They sang, whilst negligently seated,
   He ought to have conciliated

   Hath she a fitting phrase selected?
   And life and fate in turn selected
   They long at home have her expected—
   His visit she had not awaited,
   Tattiana with impatience waited
   A bastard fame prohibited?
   Vladimir Lenski visited
   How the young imp on Tania doted!
   To captivate her how devoted!
   the married women, on the other hand, in two, which are twisted
   incarceration had such an effect upon his mind that he committed
   By Olga’s hand distributed
   And every year distributed
   All mothers their sweet girls believed
   Of what he thought and what believed,
   And she at last hath us deceived;
   Lenski as a good match received,—
   In vain was youth by us received,
   journeys may be easily conceived.]
   Upon those margins she perceived
   Retained the image, though short-lived,
   The neighbourhood fresh sport derived.
   At an old aunt’s they had arrived
   Harnessed the rapid sledge arrived:
   A new proprietor arrived,
   They talked and laughed. The guests arrived.
   Which afterwards the muse revived.
   The conversation was revived
   Who had for four long years survived
   Turned and replied as it behoved,
   When but a boy he Olga loved
   Perceived that he was still beloved,
   And ditties of the steppe she loved.
   He witnessed tenderly and moved
   Already by repentance moved
   Onéguine, by first impulse moved,
   And as a country damsel roved,
   And these the attentive maid observed
   Strictly the Carnival observed,
   And ancient usages observed
   For first “madame” his wants observed,
   (For which our praise he hath deserved).

   But proudly in his song preserved
   The gifted songster never swerved,
   And when her violence reviewed—
   The breath of Spring again renewed,
   Simple and kindly and unwed,
   Without the least constraint he bowed.
   Who to the youthful hostess bowed,
   In company, or simply bowed,
   Et cetera; but nothing showed
   He gazed upon the clock which showed
   A scant attendance Lenski showed
   Till amid trees a hovel showed,
   Onéguine ne’er as poet showed
   But from the interview what flowed?
   The insensate fire of love still glowed
   And privileges nice allowed,
   Enraptured was he if allowed
   He wrote and spoke, so all allowed,
   Passion’s wild sway I then allowed,
   And necessary fools allowed.

   And when for Olga nurse arrayed

   There long time sad at heart he stayed:
   Their giddy sports she ne’er enjoyed.
   Yet was her inmost soul o’erjoyed
   Upon a soul inert and cloyed?—
   Their noisy laugh her soul annoyed,
   Of course Tattiana was annoyed
   And is all light within destroyed?

   At early morn returns the maid
   Singing inside her hut the maid
   She comprehends. The simple maid
   My pretty self-deceiving maid—
   Remained with him the youthful maid.
   In Olga’s album, youthful maid,
   And for Tattiana, mournful maid,
   Alone with my Venetian maid,
   Mine own ideal, the mountain maid,
   For shame lift up the modest maid.
   Of a young dark-eyed country maid,
   Her Martin Zadeka in aid,

   Adieu she to the matron said
   And the old nurse a brief prayer said
   Though scarcely following what was said,
   With many a vacancy, ’tis said.”—

   Mute glances interchanged aside
   In consultation stand aside—

   Suddenly to the left hand side,
   And soon Onéguine’s door beside

   And glittering simpletons beside;
   A pair of bullets—nought beside—

   Pervaded with much common sense.

   Inspired but weariness intense;

   Ladies in crowds around her close,

   Existence would not make a curse,
   “How dull you are this morning, nurse!”
   All visited him at first, of course;
   A dinner, whimsical each course,
   Of friends the grateful intercourse—
   Snorts, and his rider bends his course
   Oh, many a year hath run its course
   I lift a warning voice because
   I once forgot for your sweet cause
   The thirst for fame and man’s applause,

   Was nothing but the British spleen
   The lonely mansion-house to screen
   It blew: it howled: till winter e’en
   Upon a bunch of lovage green;
   As your light footprints on the green.
   In springtime on the meadows green,
   But plainer girls they oft had seen.
   To this arrangement can be seen,
   Nor precepts sage nor pictures e’en,
   Similar dames ye may have seen.
   Whom you in slumber may have seen.”
   The torment born of crime unseen,
   How! from the waste of steppes unseen,”—
   From gales a hill behind was seen;
   Before him red roast beef is seen
   But nothing changed in them is seen,

   In little maidens of thirteen?
   His malady, whose cause I ween
   Writ in my honour now and then—
   Her husband was a bridegroom then,
   “Onéguine, I was younger then,
   His friendship I acquired just then;
   The cold reply with gloomy mien
   Approach not to hearken
   The tale of these romantic men;
   To pass with reasonable men
   E sempre bene, gentlemen!
   Amid submissive herds of men
   Whom, as the custom is of men,
   Having abjured the haunts of men,
   And isolated from all men,
   So inaccessible to men,
   refined eulogy of the excellent qualities of our countrywomen.
   Is no more cherished amongst men.
   Where is the outlaw, banned by men,
   The poet fell; already men
   Yawning betook him to a pen.
   Of serfs the farewell wail have given.
   Another his betrothed was given;
   The imagination to enliven
   Nags eighteen to the door are driven.
   By sympathy I have been driven.
   The memory of the bard was driven
   Onéguine was a citizen
   How deftly could he transport feign!
   An exile from their troublous reign,
   Olga and Tania led. Malign,
   How bitterly he would malign,
   With roses, caps and looks malign;
   Dreading the world’s remarks malign,
   All bustle when he makes a sign:
   Landscapes thereon he would design,
   At times talk nonsense with design;
   But boldly I myself resign:
   My heart’s allegiance can resign,
   Thine honour is my countersign!
   Men opposite. The cross they sign
   My gratitude do not disdain,
   To crush me with a just disdain.
   Listen to me without disdain.
   And she to whom my lyre would fain,
   Dressed him, undressed, and dressed again?
   Should dearly like a dance again.
   Shall I behold thee once again?”—
   But to the garden once again
   The youthful lover once again
   Onéguine, bored to death again,
   A dwarf adorned with tail, again
   Onéguine—take him up again—
   That until Christmas comes again
   Of love again, and yet again;
   A maid hath oft, may yet again
   And agitate my heart again;
   Or if he meant to flirt again,
   It wakens in my breast again.
   Tattiana courage doth regain
   By an avowal just as plain.
   He there is master—that is plain;
   Zaretski rose, nor would explain,
   Without disguise ourselves explain.
   Detest him for a brother slain?
   Alas! the youthful lover slain,
   By whom the youthful bard was slain?”—
   Who selfishly unmoved remain
   Can lower depths beyond remain?
   Would she in silence long remain.
   As deaf and silly doth remain,
   He obstinately will remain,
   But, that life longer may remain,
   And gave himself but little pain
   And thus it is ’twould cause me pain
   Me now, inflict upon me pain?—
   And an habitual sense of pain;
   Spare yourself unavailing pain
   “My darling child, thou art in pain.—
   Where, where, remorse, compassion, pain?
   I know not if his heart felt pain
   And, though a plucky scatterbrain,
   The bard’s enthusiastic strain,
   Of bassoons and of flutes the strain.
   After the wedded couple strain;
   Oh, how her lips compressed restrain
   Behold, my sobs I scarce restrain—”
   Tattiana tears cannot restrain.
   Yet dares not, dedicate its strain,
   The dream left terror in its train.
   A ring she heard the ancient strain:
   Tania the meaning would obtain
   A case of books he doth obtain—
   I loved you—what did I obtain?
   My light productions to retain,
   Although her book did not contain
   The household property contain:
   His daughter’s book to ascertain
   Pair after pair the race sustain.
   Lenski the stroke could not sustain,
   Pursues phantasmagoria vain.
   And distance interposed in vain,
   Still hopes, endeavours, though in vain.
   He reads at random, reads in vain.
   And far removed from rumour vain;
   I’ve wasted in amusements vain,
   Cease the pursuit of shadows vain,
   Wherein we lately left the twain.
   Still eats and drinks enough for twain.
   And galloped home. But pistols twain,
   The converse of our hermits twain,
   To raise a clamour and a din:
   In solitude or worldly din,
   Three tears they dropt with humble mein
   Ere conversation could begin,
   But by degrees the crowd begin
   For God’s sake, Lenski, don’t begin!
   With words of foreign origin

   And seek in buzzing swarms the meads.

   Crunching the morning snow she treads;
   If they but heard domestic loads
   Come rumbling up the neighbouring roads,
   And all that from thy hand proceeds—
   “Then come with me.” The prince proceeds,
   Already dance to song proceeds;
   And rising from her bench proceeds;
   And a grand festival proceeds.
   And thus each stubbornly proceeds.
   She drinks in those seductive deeds!
   Professions eagerly for deeds,
   For riot, frolics, mighty feeds,
   The crowd unto the drawing-room speeds,
   ’Twas eve. ’Twas dusk. The river speeds
   To bring behind: the triple steeds

   In winter, when Night longer holds
   Capers applauds with clap of hands,

   Obedient to warm Spring’s commands.

   The avalanche of snow first bends,
   Tobacco smoke the flue ascends,
   Tattiana from the hill descends
   Then glittering in the sun descends.
   No one my anguish comprehends,
   The voice of lovers, foes and friends,
   Of frivolous existence, friends;
   Triumphs—their own or those of friends—
   I’ve had to make for having friends!
   Against my inclination, friends,
   Existence without wife or friends,
   The feet of my dear lady friends.
   Their harmless conversation blends
   But little warmth the fireplace lends,

   And her voice sweeter than the sounds
   Appear attuned to softer chords;
   And wild among them grew her words—
   At least their accents and their words
   perhaps worthy of remark, as one amongst numerous circumstances
   Of passion reminiscences,
   proving how extensively the poet interwove his own life-experiences
   Its cold unfeeling sentences;

   Me your perfections would not bless;

   Her cheek of rosy loveliness
   And contemplative dreaminess;

   “But strange am I to happiness;
   Or, strange to me is happiness?
   Oppressive now is happiness,

   And freezing fits of weariness.

   Their slander e’en was weariness;
   In old age life is weariness!”
   Amid the awful emptiness
   This glitter, riot, emptiness,
   In rhyming I show laziness.

   And though I read it with distress,

   Her tresses curled in fashion saw,

   With its exhilarating flow,
   From happy inspiration flow,

   Nought from his pen did ever flow,
   Where plentifully feelings flow
   They sat, but conversation’s flow

   Behold her downcast eyes which glow,
   And herds of oxen wandering low;
   Whose countless golden crosses glow

   What, invitations? The same day

   Unto their solitude one day,

   In haunts of fashion where each day

   Well! just as she was yesterday.

   We visit about Christmas Day,
   She gazed around her—it was day.
   And wholly occupied his day—
   Olga’s admirer came that day:
   Had much to do at home that day,
   As men who much had done that day.
   That he was “ready any day.”
   She was as heedless and as gay—
   Time was, his raillery was gay,
   Down in the courtyard magpies gay,
   In yarns of youthful troopers gay,
   Till morn—life uniform but gay,
   And for a time our course delay,
   Arrange without the least delay—
   The bridegroom sage without delay
   “Bring dinner now without delay!”
   One morn whilst yet in bed he lay,
   No senseless fashionable lay
   How sick to death his uncle lay
   With pallid light, but Eugene lay
   Within his memory there lay,
   “How often in thine arms I lay;
   Then, her distraction to allay,
   In jersey and in nightcap lay.
   How with thy medal I would play,
   The military band will play.

   Curtly announcing for the fray
   With boiling torrent dark and gray;
   “To-morrow’s dawn will glimmer gray,
   Driving abreast three horses gray.

   His intellect in close array.
   Behind, of glasses an array,
   But I abandoned their array,

   All with urbanity betray,
   Nor doth my absent pen portray
   Minutely I will now portray.
   Tattiana purchased with a stray
   So frequently his mind would stray
   Thither hussars on leave will stray
   Is this the same Tattiana, say,
   And thus unto her nurse did say:
   Discourse of Bentham or of Say,
   Surveying them, she thus doth say:
   And starting suddenly doth say:
   It is called by the natives “doushegreika,” that is to say,
   Almost became a poet say—
   “Tell me, why doth your comrade stay?”
   Alone beneath your rooftree stay
   Transfixed Onéguine mine doth stay.
   He cared no longer there to stay,
   Horror! had she not better stay
   But it grew late; he must not stay;
   A passing snowstorm wreathed away
   Nor did her blushes fade away,
   The starry beacons fade away,
   Carried a truth divine away;
   Onéguine Olga bore away.
   How oft the kindly Muse away
   And gallops to her house away.
   As it were, tore himself away.
   Ah! what hath fate not torn away!
   From the dread pistol turn away.
   Without a chance to slip away.
   The mystic lines to tear away
   Deep in the greenwood far away?
   And to Onéguine far away
   But thoughts meander far away—
   Lost in the hamlet far away.
   But borne in spirit far away
   Alas! Tattiana fades away,
   But Summer swiftly fades away
   I write, and anguish flies away,
   And calmly sleeps the hours away,
   It whiled his idle hours away
   The lily’s stem to eat away,
   Unto her husband, went away—
   With serious air then went away
   Resolved the flirt to cast away,
   Take to their wings and fly away.
   There jars of cider block the way,
